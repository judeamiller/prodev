				<h3>My Learning Style</h3>
				<p><strong>Visual</strong></p>
				<p>30% Auditory</p>
				<p>55% Visual</p>
				<p>15% Tactile</p>
				<br>

				<h3>Quantitative Accomplishments</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>I have educated over 600 high school students in science classes over the past 5 years.</li>
					<li>Was a production member of the planning team responsible for creating a recovery plan for the 2 million acre Former Bennet Freeze area of the Navajo Nation.</li>
					<li>I completed my undergraduate degree in three years.</li>
				</ul>
				<br>
				<h3>Qualitative Features</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>I am a perfectionist so I am committed to getting things right the first time, this can be a negative because I can often over work a project.</li>
					<li>I like problem solving. I like to see a problem through the end. This means that I prefer to understand what
						is going on rather than accepting a fix. This can mean that I spend too much time on one thing.</li>
					<li>I am socially awkward and do not like initiating conversation so I do not waste time with extraneous conversation.</li>
				</ul>
				<br>
				<h3>Golden Circle</h3>
				<ol>
					<li><strong>Why: </strong>  I want a change of career into a field where I can make things and problem solve.
						Be more creative, and have attainable outcomes and have upward mobility so I can better provide for my family. </li>
					<li><strong>How:</strong>Complete Deep Dive Full-Stack, attend meet-ups/etc in order to become connected with people in the ABQ tech sector.</li>
					<li><strong>What: </strong> Get a web development job with a focus on UI/UX.</li>
				</ol>

				<br>
				<h3>Elevator Pitch</h3>
				<p><strong>Version 1</strong></p>
				<p>I am changing my career into a web development path. I want to work work in a field where I can problem-solve
					and build things. I am working on this career change by completing the Deep Dive Full-stack bootcamp and
					attending meet-ups to become connected with people in the ABQ tech sector. Do you work in web development?</p>
				<p><strong>Version 2</strong></p>
				<p>Hello I am Jude Baca-Miller and I build websites and web applications. I am currently enrolled in Deep Dive Fullstack Bootcamp and am looking to work for an Albuquerque web development firm where I can continue building my web development skill set. Do you know know someone who is expanding their business?

				<h3>Visual Speaks</h3>
				<img class="rounded" src="./images/visualspeaks.jpg" alt="picture of activity pictures"/>
				<p><strong>Image 1: </strong> The first image I picked is the dirty window. To me this represents seeing a light
					at the end of the tunnel. In my case this metaphor of light at the end of the tunnel is a path toward a career
					that will better provide for my family.</p>
				<p><strong>Image 2: </strong>The second image I picked is of two people successfully completing the assembly of
					an Ikea table. To me this represents accomplishment.</p>

				<h2>Weekly Reflections</h2>
				<h3>Week 1</h3>
				<p>In my first week at Deep Dive, I have learned that there is a great deal to learn in a short amount of time.
					Before taking this class, I have done many different online courses over small bits of web development. This
					class will help me figure out how to put it all together. I am very mechanically inclined, so I like to think
					of a website like a machine. I know a little about a few individual parts, but I still need to learn about
					even more pieces and how they fit together.</p>
				<h3>Week 2</h3>
				<p>This week was more challenging for me. We have moved beyond the basics of web design and into the backend with a focus on object oriented development.
					I need to learn much more about the structure of PHP and PHP data objects, which is how PHP interfaces with mySQL.
					The code	looks daunting right now, but I know that I need to analyze the code block by block then write my own PDO code for my data design project.
					Once I get the hang of doing a couple of PDO methods, the rest is basic arithmetic.</p>
				<h3>Week 3</h3>
				<p>This week we were assigned our capstone projects. I am working with Adel, Joe, and Asya on a webapp with the
					intent of reuniting lost pets with their owners. This week we were able to draft an outline of our data-design.<br>
					<br>I am also working on the start of my PWP by experimenting with various wire framing applications and am  also working on my
					professional development by updating my LinkedIn and resume. Over the weekend I plan on spending time doing some self study into
					bootstrap and css so I can improve the presentation of my websites.</p>
				<h3>Week 4</h3>
				<p>This week focused primarily on our capstone projects. I took on the Animal Class of our "lost-paws" project.
					The animal entity has 11 attributes, the largest class of our project. I am glad I am taking on this large class, because it is giving me an
					opportunity to learn more about php. I am currently struggling to understand builidng a unit test, but feel confident that I will pick it up as
					I go along.</p>
				<p>In addition to capstone work, we were introduced to bootstrap. Because I am interested in UI/UX, this was the most
					enjoyable learning experience this week. I really enjoyed working on the bootstrap challenge, because I can
					see how I can use this in building static websites.</p>
				<p><strong>Why I love to code: </strong>I love learning about code because I love learning how to do things myself.
					I typically work on things in the physical realm for enjoyment, like cars or home improvent projects. I see coding as something similar, building things,
					but using different tools.</p>

				<h3>Web Identity</h3>
				<h4> Below is a map of my web identities:</h4>
				<table>
					<tr>
						<th> </th>
						<th>Professional</th>
						<th>Personal</th>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td class="leftTitle">Identity:</td>
						<td>Jude Baca-Miller, Judeamiller</td>
						<td>judeabm, ABQ-Y2kSE</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td class="leftTitle">Channels:</td>
						<td>GitHub, LinkedIn, Twitter, StackOverflow</td>
						<td>Instagram, Miata.net, Mazda3Revolution, MazdaRoadster.net, BikeForum, AudioKarma</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>

						<td>Web Developer, Person interested in Albuquerque community</td>
						<td>Person who takes pictures of landscapes and dogs, Car Nut, Cyclist, Vintage Audio Enthusiast</td>
					</tr>
				</table>
				<p>I do not have a significant web presence. Right now the main thing you will find about me on a google search
					is that I was a teacher, I worked at CNM, and I am on the 1993 LE Miata registry. My web presence is very limited
					and my personal and professional personas are easily linked, but I am okay with this. Over the coming weeks,
					I want to continue to build my professional presence by building on the channels I have linked in the
					professional column.</p>
				<h3>Forbidden Island Game Reflection</h3>
				<p>The forbidden island game was a good exercise in team building. I found that Joe was an excellent leader in
					helping every group member universally understand the rules. Adel and Asya were great team players. They were
					deliberate in their actions to help the overall group and were clear and concise communicators when voicing
					potential future moves for the group. I found that I had to voice my actions with my group when it was my turn
					to make sure that we were all on the same page for our strategic "exit" of the island. This game is unlike most
					others, where players need to communicate with each other to have a strategy to "win" the game as a group.
