				<h3>Visual Speaks</h3>

				<h3>Marketing Activity Questions for August 7, 2018</h3>
				<p><strong>Dan's First Question: </strong>"Has anyone ever told you that you got potential? Do you believe it? Why, Why not?"</p>

				<h2>Weekly Reflections</h2>
				<h3>Week 1</h3>
				<p>In my first week at Deep Dive, I have learned that there is a great deal to learn in a short amount of time.
					Before taking this class, I have done many different online courses over small bits of web development. This
					class will help me figure out how to put it all together. I am very mechanically inclined, so I like to think
					of a website like a machine. I know a little about a few individual parts, but I still need to learn about
					even more pieces and how they fit together.</p>
				<h3>Week 2</h3>
				<p>This week was more challenging for me. We have moved beyond the basics of web design and into the backend with a focus on object oriented development.
					I need to learn much more about the structure of PHP and PHP data objects, which is how PHP interfaces with mySQL.
					The code	looks daunting right now, but I know that I need to analyze the code block by block then write my own PDO code for my data design project.
					Once I get the hang of doing a couple of PDO methods, the rest is basic arithmetic.</p>
				<h3>Week 3</h3>
				<p>This week we were assigned our capstone projects. I am working with Adel, Joe, and Asya on a webapp with the
					intent of reuniting lost pets with their owners. This week we were able to draft an outline of our data-design.<br>
					<br>I am also working on the start of my PWP by experimenting with various wire framing applications and am  also working on my
					professional development by updating my LinkedIn and resume. Over the weekend I plan on spending time doing some self study into
					bootstrap and css so I can improve the presentation of my websites.</p>
				<h3>Week 4</h3>
				<p>This week focused primarily on our capstone projects. I took on the Animal Class of our "lost-paws" project.
					The animal entity has 11 attributes, the largest class of our project. I am glad I am taking on this large class, because it is giving me an
					opportunity to learn more about php. I am currently struggling to understand builidng a unit test, but feel confident that I will pick it up as
					I go along.</p>
				<p>In addition to capstone work, we were introduced to bootstrap. Because I am interested in UI/UX, this was the most
					enjoyable learning experience this week. I really enjoyed working on the bootstrap challenge, because I can
					see how I can use this in building static websites.</p>
				<p><strong>Why I love to code: </strong>I love learning about code because I love learning how to do things myself.
					I typically work on things in the physical realm for enjoyment, like cars or home improvement projects. I see coding as something similar, building things,
					but using different tools.</p>
				<h3>Week 5</h3>
				<p> This week my group finished their capstone classes and tests. This gave me some time to begin working on my PWP project over the
					weekend. I currently have my pwp looking very much like my wireframe, but I now need to begin making content to replace the lorem ipsum.
					toward the end of the week, the class we started working on JavaScript. I am really looking forward to using JS, because it is so
					commonplace in the industry.</p>
				<p>During this week I have also started working on my job search. I have been in contact with a few people at Rural Sourcing and have sent my resume.</p>
				<p><strong>Why I love to code: </strong> I love to code because it is like a big puzzle. Eventually the pieces click into place.</p>
				<h3>Week 6</h3>
				<p>This week has been very productive. My capstone group began working on building and testing their APIs. We were able to get our APIs written but we did have some delay in
					testing due to needing input from Dylan and George in setting up a method to test our oAuth sign-in. On Friday we were able to successfully begin testing
					the APIs in Insomnia.app. While waiting to test our APIs I was able to work on my PWP project and get George's approval for Milestone 2b 50% check-in.</p>
				<p>This week I also began working on networking within the tech community. I attended 1 Million Cups with the class, attended the intro to React Meetup at Lavu, and
					scheduled an informational interview with a potential employer.</p>
				<p><strong>Why I love to code: </strong> I stand by my week 5 statement. This week we begin fitting together the frontend and back-end pieces of the puzzle.
					I enjoy the feeling of success when I remove a bug and make things work.</p>
				<h3>Week 7</h3>
				<p>The beginning of this week began with finishing up and debugging our APIs. Our capstone group was able to get their API tickets burned this week.
					We are now moving along to building our site's front end with Angular 6. I have also finalized the format of my PWP, and now need to focus on building
					the actual content of my website. In addition to working on projects, I have continued working on professional development by talking to employers and
					people working in the web development community.</p>
				<p><strong>Why I love to code: </strong> I love problem solving. As someone who prefers working in an engineering type setting, I appreciate that coding is filled with
					problems that are challenging, but solvable with logic.</p>
				<h3>Week 8</h3>
				<p>This week was very interview-centric. I had my first interview for a tech position on Wednesday at a local tech firm. On Friday we had mock-interviews as the main portion of our class.
					I spent most of my free time studying and practicing JavaScript functions in order to prepare for my technical interviews. I feel that having two opportunities to interview has helped me become
					more familiar with the style of interview I will encounter in my job search for a web development position. The marker board portion of my mock interview was much less stressful than I anticipated,
					because I just pretented to be in front of a science class again.</p>
				<p><strong>Why I love to code: </strong> I like a challenge. Grasping the fundamentals of Angular is a challenge.</p>
				<h3>Week 9</h3>
				<p>This week our group saw our project start to take formation from static ui pieces to a  full fledged web app. This short week was filled with lots of debugging and asking questions.
					On Friday our group began planning for our capstone presentations that will be demonstrated on graduation day next week.</p>
				<p><strong>Why I love to code: </strong> You can see an idea become a real and working reality.</p>

				<h3>Web Identity</h3>

				<p>I do not have a significant web presence. Right now the main thing you will find about me on a google search
					is that I was a teacher, I worked at CNM, and I am on the 1993 LE Miata registry. My web presence is very limited
					and my personal and professional personas are easily linked, but I am okay with this. Over the coming weeks,
					I want to continue to build my professional presence by building on the channels I have linked in the
					professional column.</p>
				<h3>Forbidden Island Game Reflection</h3>
				<p>The forbidden island game was a good exercise in team building. I found that Joe was an excellent leader in
					helping every group member universally understand the rules. Adel and Asya were great team players. They were
					deliberate in their actions to help the overall group and were clear and concise communicators when voicing
					potential future moves for the group. I found that I had to voice my actions with my group when it was my turn
					to make sure that we were all on the same page for our strategic "exit" of the island. This game is unlike most
					others, where players need to communicate with each other to have a strategy to "win" the game as a group.
