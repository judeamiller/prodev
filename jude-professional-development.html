			<h3>Elevator Pitch</h3>
			<p><strong>Version 1</strong></p>
			<p>I am changing my career into a web development path. I want to work work in a field where I can problem-solve
				and build things. I am working on this career change by completing the Deep Dive Full-stack bootcamp and
				attending meet-ups to become connected with people in the ABQ tech sector. Do you work in web development?</p>
			<p><strong>Version 2</strong></p>
			<p>Hello I am Jude Baca-Miller and I build websites and web applications. I am currently enrolled in Deep Dive Fullstack Bootcamp and am looking to work for an Albuquerque web development firm where I can continue building my web development skill set. Do you know know someone who is expanding their business?

			<h3>Visual Speaks</h3>
			<img src="./images/visualspeaks.jpg" alt="picture of activity pictures"/>
			<p><strong>Image 1: </strong> The first image I picked is the dirty window. To me this represents seeing a light at the end of the tunnel. In my case this metaphor of light at the end of the tunnel is a path toward a career that will better provide for my family.</p>
			<p><strong>Image 2: </strong>The second image I picked is of two people successfully completing the assembly of an Ikea table. To me this represents accomplishment.</p>

			<h2>Weekly Reflections</h2>
			<br>
			<h3>Week 1</h3>
			<p>In my first week at Deep Dive, I have learned that there is a great deal to learn in a short amount of time.
				Before taking this class, I have done many different online courses over small bits of web development. This
				class will help me figure out how to put it all together. I am very mechanically inclined, so I like to think
				of a website like a machine. I know a little about a few individual parts, but I still need to learn about
				even more pieces and how they fit together.</p>
			<h3>Week 2</h3>
			<p>This week was more challenging for me. We have moved beyond the basics of web design and into the backend with a focus on object oriented development.
				I need to learn much more about the structure of PHP and PHP data objects, which is how PHP interfaces with mySQL.
				The code	looks daunting right now, but I know that I need to analyze the code block by block then write my own PDO code for my data design project.
				Once I get the hang of doing a couple of PDO methods, the rest is basic arithmetic.</p>
