			<h2>Weekly Reflections</h2>
			<br>
			<h3>Week 1</h3>
			<p>In my first week at Deep Dive, I have learned that there is a great deal to learn in a short amount of time.
				Before taking this class, I have done many different online courses over small bits of web development. This
				class will help me figure out how to put it all together. I am very mechanically inclined, so I like to think
				of a website like a machine. I know a little about a few individual parts, but I still need to learn about
				even more pieces and how they fit together.</p>
